Update (Apr 2021):  Ported Google Apps Scripts to python for more control over functionality and as a backup.  The method to retrieve the Tesla authentication token changed and along with it, security blocking of the Google 
servers such that the REST calls stopped working.  They work when running from python on my own machine/IP address.


These scripts are based on Google Apps Script (https://script.google.com/home), which is free!  There are 4 components to this project:

1.  Smart Charger.gs - sends an email if you forget to plug in your vehicle and calculates then sets the optimal charge start time.
2.  Telemetry.gs - logs data from your vehicle for analysis, e.g. miles, efficiency, battery capacity, etc.
3.  Smart Climate.gs - customized scheduling of pre-heating/cooling of cabin and seat heating by day of the week.
4.  Logging.gs - logs error messages in the try/catch blocks.

I need to find a way to either share the Google Sheets format or refactor these into a database.

I created several in-depth videos walking through the functionality and code:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1pqhlGSuVg&list=PLgiPnlzk2O712gwiTIquUzdfVlzIMyS2M
