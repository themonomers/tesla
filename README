/google
These scripts are based on Google Apps Script (https://script.google.com/home), which is free!  There are 5 components to this project:

1.  SmartCharger.gs - sends an email if you forget to plug in your vehicle and calculates then sets the optimal charge start time.
2.  index.html - part of a Google Apps Script deployed webapp that runs client side JavaScript to work with the getToken() in SmartCharger.gs.
3.  Telemetry.gs - logs data from your vehicle for analysis, e.g. miles, efficiency, battery capacity, etc.
4.  SmartClimate.gs - customized scheduling of pre-heating/cooling of cabin and seat heating by day of the week.
5.  Logging.gs - logs error messages in the try/catch blocks.

I need to find a way to either share the Google Sheets format or refactor these into a database.

I created several in-depth videos walking through the functionality and code:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1pqhlGSuVg&list=PLgiPnlzk2O712gwiTIquUzdfVlzIMyS2M

Separate project:  GoogleSheetScriptEditor.gs - add to a Google Sheet script editor as a more simple way to get API data.

/python
Ported Tesla Google Apps Scripts to python for more control over functionality and as a backup. Additional scripts for Tesla Energy products that run on local machines as they are writing to InfluxDB and I don't want to open that to the internet.
